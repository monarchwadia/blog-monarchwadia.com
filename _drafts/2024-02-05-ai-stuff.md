# Ideas

## Content Tagging & Organization (Zero-shot Classification)

Implement zero-shot classification to automatically tag and organize user-generated content or articles without pre-defined categories, enhancing content discoverability.

## User Intent Prediction (Zero-shot Classification)

Use zero-shot classification to predict user intent based on their queries or interactions, allowing for dynamic responses or content adjustments.

## Automated Data Cleaning

Employ AI to detect and correct inaccuracies or inconsistencies in user input or imported datasets, ensuring data quality and reliability.

## Natural Language Processing for Data Normalization

Utilize NLP techniques to standardize textual data, such as converting informal language to a more formal equivalent or ensuring consistent date formats.

## Enhanced Search Functionality (Semantic Search)

Incorporate semantic search capabilities into your project, allowing users to perform natural language queries and receive more relevant results through understanding of context and user intent.

## Dynamic Summaries for Long Content

Use AI to generate concise summaries of long articles, reports, or user-generated content, improving user engagement and content accessibility.

## Behavior Prediction Models

Implement AI models to predict user actions, such as potential churn or the likelihood of purchase, based on their interaction patterns, enabling proactive engagement strategies.

## AI-Driven A/B Testing

Utilize AI to automate the selection and adjustment of A/B testing parameters in real-time, optimizing the testing process for faster iteration and improvement.
