# Intro

Many people think GenAI is futuristic. Actually, it's pretty boring.

For example, it can act as a complement or substitute for regex matching.

We sometimes use Regex, or complex rules, to identify the type of document we are dealing with. This often takes a lot of trial and error. Maintenance, too, can become hellish because of the high complexity of the code.

Instead, what if we do content tagging with GPT technology?

# Problem case

We need a compelling problem case here. What to put?

- Right now, engineers rely heavily on human-driven manual tagging. Or, sometimes, engineers use simple keyword-based algorithms for categorizing a vast array of news articles.
- This approach is not only time-consuming but also prone to inaccuracies due to the human factor. It is expensive, and cannot keep up with the volume of content published daily.

# Proposed solution: GPT-based Content Tagging

- Use GPT for zero-shot classification. 
- Doesn't need training. Simple prompt engineering will do.
- Output is delivered through a callback mechanism.
- Advantages: It is efficient, accurate, and scalable.
- Impact: 
  - Improved user experience by providing more accuratly categorized and personalized content feeds.
  - Editorial Workflow: reduces the workload on editorial teams, allowing them to focus on content creation and curation rather than manual tagging.
  - Business Value: Improves content discovery and engagement, potentially increasing user retention and ad revenuef or the platform.
- Considerations:
  - Ethical Bias concerns.
  - Continuous Learning: how to make it adapt and improve over time?
